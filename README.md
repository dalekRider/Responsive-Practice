# Responsive/Workflow Practice

This is a basic site built for workflow practice setting up a project environment with Atom. This project uses Prepros to process SASS it also relies on Atom's github integration and Github Desktop.

This project was completed following Kevin Powell's workflow tutorial

Other than cosmetic changes (fonts, images, colors, and padding) this is basically a clone of Kevin's build. The main purpose for this is to better acquaint myself with SASS, Preprocessors, Atom's Github integration, as well as Github desktop. I did wrestle with naming conventions while following along with this tutorial. At times I tried to follow a BEM conventions but found myself mixing up BEM with Kevin's own naming convention. I believe starting a new site from scratch and breaking it down into modules and components will make it easier to stick to a single naming convention, which I plan to do. 

Overall this was a fantastic tutorial. For me it was a crash course into prepros which fixed all of my sass processing frustrations prior to this. Additionally, it gave me more hands on experience with SASS. 

Unfinished Business:
  - fix footer navigation links
  - replace guitar image w/ full guitar
  - tweak button size
  - cta modal possibly
