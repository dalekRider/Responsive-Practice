# Responsive/Workflow Practice

This is a basic site built for workflow practice setting up a project environment with Atom. This project uses Prepros to process SASS it also relies on Atom's github integration and Github Desktop.

This project was completed following Kevin Powell's workflow tutorial:<br>

Other than cosmetic changes (fonts, images, colors, and padding) this is basically a clone of Kevin's build. The main purpose for this is to better acquaint myself with SASS, Preprocessors, Atom's Github integration, as well as Github desktop. I did wrestle with naming conventions while following along with this tutorial. At times I tried to follow a BEM conventions but found myself mixing up BEM with Kevin's own naming convention. I believe starting a new site from scratch and breaking it down into modules and components will make it easier to stick to a single naming convention, which I plan to do. 

Overall this was a fantastic tutorial. For me it was a crash course into prepros which fixed all of my sass processing frustrations prior to this. Additionally, it gave me more hands on experience with SASS.
